1. Apache instance. Ingredients:
  * identifier /^[a-z][a-z0-9_]+/,
  * instance of running apache daemon,
  * user who runs the instance,
  * entry in /etc/rc.conf (or appropriate system-wide config file),
  * own httpd.conf file (in separate subdirectory, for example),
  * lock file, mutex and whatever (need to study),
  * list of loaded modules (to define available directives),
2. Module. Ingredients:
  * name,
  * directives,
3. Directive. Ingredients:
  * name,
  * type (section?),
  * syntax,
  * contextlist,
4. Section. Ingredients:
  * name,
  * context (what context it pushes into context stack, if any),
5. Context stack. A context is simply a string. They're pushed into context
  stack by sections.

NOTE 1: In apache, a section is just a special type of directive.
NOTE 2: Directives are case insensitive in apache.
NOTE 3: Need to handle compiled-in modules (i.e. these without LoadModule).

Patterns:

1. Directives: "object pool", that is a hash with directive name as key,
2. Sections: subset of directives -
