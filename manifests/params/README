When adding new default parameter, let say 'myparam' copy template.pp to
myparam.pp, and modify it to your needs. After that modify
spec/unit/classes/defaults_spec.rb.

When adding support for new OS, first extend template.pp by adding new entry to
its hash, then walk through all other *.pp files in this directory and add
appropriate lines (should be easy). Please keep OS-specific lines in
alphabetical order.
